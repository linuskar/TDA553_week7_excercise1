## Exercises
* Complete the installation of the class Tuple. The idea is it should act as a tuple in e.g. Python. It should hold two values of (possibly) different arbitrary types, and have the methods fst() and snd() to return the first and second components, respectively.

The code in TestTuple.java should run successfully if your implementation is correct.
*     Look at the code for AnimalShelter and its surrounding classes. Look especially at ShelterError. How can we change this, so that it is not possible to put dogs in a cat home, and vice versa, without losing code reuse or extensibility? We want to receive a static error message, not an error (exception) at runtime!
